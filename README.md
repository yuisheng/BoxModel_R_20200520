# Info
 * The corresponding paper is Zhang et al., (2020): "Domintant contribution of anthropogenic emissions to the rise of atmospheric methane".
 * This box model code is a rewrite of Matlab code from Turner et al., 2017: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1616020114.
 * The R code can be run using the "runScript.R" file.
 * The bottom-up estimates use publicly available datasets (details can be found in the Data Availability of the paper). As such, we have not included those datasets in the repository.
 * Users could manually download the data by contacting the PIs for those datasets.
 * The inputs of box model that are aggreagted from the bottom-up estimates are provided in the 'inputs' folder in the format of R data.
